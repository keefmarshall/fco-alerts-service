/**
 * Load the world.geo.json file into MongoDB as an array of features - each 
 * feature as a separate Mongo object (rather than the whole collection as one Mongo
 * object) - the MongoDB docs are pretty light on info as to how the data should look
 * inside Mongo, and I can't find any good examples, so this is a bit of a stab in the
 * dark. 
 * 
 * NOTE you need MongoDB version 2.5.x or higher to support MultiPolygons, which hasn't
 * yet been released and certainly isn't supported via Heroku!! So, we have
 * to split out the multi ones into single polygons which is a right pain.
