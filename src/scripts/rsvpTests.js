// Checking that all() and allSettled() do parallel execution
// - which, I'm glad to report, they do :)
//
// Notes:
// allSettled() appears to never set 'rejected' state, it always
// fulfills after everything has completed but with a list of states 
// for each promise that you should check for failure.
//
// By contrast, all() only reports the first error state and it does this as
// soon as it occurs, so there is a very real danger that the remaining tasks 
// will still be in progress at this point. I recommend always using allSettled()
// for this reason as it will only fulfill once everything has finished.
