// This is a lot trickier than it looks, because most of the

// that the Node.js instance physically quits when done.
// 
// It's especially important when using the Heroku Scheduler, because I'll
// get charged money for the length of time this is running if it goes over the
// free hours.
//
// I've switched everything to use RSVP promises, so this should, in theory, always 
// return and exit nicely.
//
// Just in case, I've got a failsafe:
// Very crudely, time out after max of thirty seconds has passed, to minimise costs:
// [clearly this is dangerous, stuff might well still be running in the background]
