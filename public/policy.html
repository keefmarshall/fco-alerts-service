    <h1>FCO Alerts: Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>
        The Android application FCO Alerts requires access to certain permissions on your
        device in order to function. Although it asks for the "accounts" permission, please
        be assured that no personal details are retrieved from the device. It is purely to
        retrieve an account identifier for use with the Google Cloud Message system, which
        is used for the alert notifications you receive on your phone.
    </p>

    <p>
        No personal or sensitive data is retrieved or stored by this application. We only store
        any country preferences you have set, and an identifier returned to us from the GCM
        system that allows us to send alerts to your device.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The source code for the application is available to view on Github via the links below.
